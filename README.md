# ObjectOrientedJSGame
I created this browser-based, Star Trek themed word guessing game for the Treehouse Full Stack Javascript Techdegree. Building upon provided CSS and HTML I use Object-Oriented Javascript to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on the onscreen or physical keyboard. I've also added additional CSS styling, images and created custom combadge icons in GravitDesigner to track the player's lives.
